Huffman Tree Project:

Input File:
	It contains a list of <char prob> pairs with the following format.
	The input prob (probability) are integers, has been multiplied by 100. 
	The input char should be treated as string.

Output Files:
	1. It should contain the Huffman <char code> pairs
	2. It should contain the pre-order traversal of the Huffman binary tree.
	3. It should contain the in-order traversal of the Huffman binary tree.
	4. It should contain the post-order traversal of the Huffman binary tree.
	5. It should contain the debugging output.
